# Welcome to our very first coding workshop!

Today we'll be using this basic HTML template as the starting point for a simple webpage project. To get started, 

1. Click the "Download ZIP" button and save the .zip file onto your computer (the desktop is a great place for a project like this). 
2. Once saved, unzip the archived folder (double-clicking). 
3. Drag the unzipped folder into your empty editor window and we're ready to go.

Let's get started!
